# motif

Biological Background:

1 the purpose to find motif：Finding the same interval of DNA in the genomes of two different or ganisms(often taken from different species) is highly suggestive that the interval hasthe same function in both organisms.

2 motif：We define a motif as such a commonly shared interval of DNA.

3 repeats：The situation is complicated by the fact that genomes are riddled with intervals of DNAthat occur multiple times (possibly with slight modifications), called repeats.
